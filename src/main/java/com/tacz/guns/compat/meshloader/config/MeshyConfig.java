/**
 * TacZ Mesh Loader 客户端配置。挂在 TACZ 的 {@code ClientConfig} 上。

 * <h2>范围</h2>
 * <p>collector（VertexConsumer）渲染路径 + 解析缓存 + 顶点预算闸门，
 * 外加 GPU 静态烘焙（{@code MeshGpuBaking} 起总闸，见 {@code PolyMeshGpuRenderer}）：
 * 手部 pass（第 1/2 步）与世界 pass（第 3 步，{@code MeshGpuWorld}）各一张表、
 * 各自在自己的 flush 处消费；GUI / 预览 / 镜内 / 阴影由<b>提交侧</b>闸门挡在表外
 * —— 关 PR #33/#69/#70/#71 的「世界 pass 泄漏」正是提交侧没闸门 + 绘制时矩阵取自
 * 错误时刻两件事叠出来的。光影下两条路（{@code MeshGpuUnderShaders} /

 * 发现「高模枪挡住太阳/月亮的那部分几何会继承天体的自发光亮度」（只有把这两个键关掉才消失，
 * 第一人称、第三人称、展示台三种语境一致）→ 一度改回默认关 → <b>R3 定稿（2026-09-01

 * 可观测、随时可以整键关闭回退的取舍，不再作为默认关的理由。附带修掉一条相关缺陷：以前「拿不到 lightmap」会一次性闩锁并把
 * 整条路退化到 {@code EMISSIVE} 管线，而那条管线在光影包眼里是「自发光、不受阴影」；现在
 * 光影下拿不到 lightmap 直接退回 collector（见 {@code PolyMeshGpuRenderer#gpuMasterUsable}）。
 * 失联/异常时两条路也各自静默回 collector。详见 {@code docs/TML_GPU_STEP2_HANDFLUSH_20260831.md}
